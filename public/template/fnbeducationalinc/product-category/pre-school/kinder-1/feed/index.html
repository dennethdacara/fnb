		<description><![CDATA[Subject: Language Made Easy Kinder 1

Author: Enerita Q. Cruz

Language Made Easy for Kinder 1 encourages the pupils to begin to speak in English or make a good try of it. The lessons begin with “Getting to Know One Another” in order to learn to talk about themselves, their families, and about others. Lessons about the school as well as the places and things used in school are presented and emphasized to help them appreciate learning in school. Eventually, they will move on to the lessons about their community and learn about the places, the community helpers, and how to be part of the community. Language skills through joyful activities like songs, rhymes, games, and poems are given. The playtime activities and action songs make them understand name words, action words, colors, shapes, sizes, and many more.

It is hoped that through the lessons in this book, they will be able to speak orally well and strive to carry on dialogues with others.]]></description>
