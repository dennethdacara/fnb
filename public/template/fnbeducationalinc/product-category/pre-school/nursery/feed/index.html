		<description><![CDATA[Subject: Language Made Easy

Author: Ana Liza O. Tupas

“Language Made Easy” for Nursery aims to give children a head start in speaking and learning the English language easily. Children need to communicate with their peers, teachers, parents, and other people around them. Every lesson in this book encourages children to confidently talk about themselves, their family, school, and community.

This book was designed to aid the teacher in teaching the lessons, as well as in helping the children understand and do what is asked of them.

It is hoped that, eventually, the users of this book will speak with confidence, write with ease, and use the English language correctly.]]></description>
