These have been grouped in logical progression to develop muscular coordination. There is focus on the form, size, spacing, and line quality of letters and numbers. Language and Reading, as well as Art activities and skill development, have been integrated in the handwriting lessons. Cursive writing is introduced at the latter part of the book in preparation for grade 1 work.
