		<description><![CDATA[Subject:  Moving Ahead in Science and Technology 10

Author: Rachel Patricia B. Ramirez, Regina Carla D. Regalado-Taduran, Laurice A. Pineda, Zenaida P. Bojo

The fourth book in an innovative series for Junior High School students. The series is aligned with the guiding principles of the K–12 Curriculum of the Department of Education. The content is presented to engage you in understanding and applying scientific knowledge, in performing science process skills, and in demonstrating scientific attitudes and values. The wealth of activities provides you with valuable experiences that will help     you realize that science is relevant in your daily lives, that science can be challenging but fun and exciting as well, and that science is crucial to your preparation for the world of work. The K–12 Curriculum follows a spiral progression and integrates varied concepts and skills in Earth Science, Physics, Biology, and Chemistry.

Unit I: Develops the understanding of earthquakes, volcanoes, and mountain ranges using a revolutionary theory called Plate Tectonics.

Unit II: Starts with a discussion of the relationship between electricity and magnetism. This chapter provides you with the fundamentals needed finally to make sense of the concepts involved in power generation, transmission, and distribution that were introduced in Unit IV of Moving Ahead in Science and Technology 9. The unit ends with a chapter that describes reflection and refraction as two important properties of light in image formation.

Unit III focuses on the following biological themes: (1) parts and functions of living organisms; (2) inheritance and variation of traits; (3) biodiversity and evolution; and (4) ecosystems.]]></description>
