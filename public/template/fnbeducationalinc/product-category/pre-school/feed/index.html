		<description><![CDATA[Subject: Writing Made Easy Kinder 2

Author:  Enerita Q. Cruz

Writing Made Easy has been prepared to develop and continually hone the preschool child’s motor skills. During the formative years of the child’s development, he/she must learn the proper ways and techniques of handwriting that will prepare him/her for more structured and formal writing activities.

This book will develop the different strokes for letters and numbers: horizontal, vertical, slanting or diagonal lines, as well as curved and circular lines. These have been grouped in logical progression to develop muscular coordination. There is focus on the form, size, spacing, and line quality of letters and numbers.

Language and Reading, as well as Art activities and skill development, have been integrated in the handwriting lessons.

Cursive writing is introduced at the latter part of the book in preparation for grade 1 work.

It is hoped that a high level of curiosity and interest will be maintained as each pupil undergoes practice writing using this book.]]></description>
